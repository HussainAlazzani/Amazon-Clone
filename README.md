# Amazon clone website
This is a react js project in which I follow along a tutorial to create a clone of the amazon website. The website consists of the following features required in most e-commerce websites:

- [x] A home/products page
- [x] A shopping cart
- [ ] User accounts and a login page
- [ ] A checkout/payment page
- [ ] An purchase history
